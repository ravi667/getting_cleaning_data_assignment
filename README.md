## Peer Assignment for the course: Getting and Cleaning Data

### Project goal:
The goal of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect,
work with, and clean a data set, and finally to prepare a tidy data that
can be used for later analysis.

### Data provided:
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

### Instructions provided for Data cleaning process:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

### Documents to be submitted at GitHub repo:
- run_analysis.R 
- CodeBook.md
- README.md (this file)

## Info for Peers:
1. In the 'run_analysis.R' file, you will find R codes listed below steps 1 to 5, which corresponds to the instructions stated above.
2. The 'CodeBook.md' file is divided into three sections:
 * Section 1 Introduction to the datasets.
 * Section 2 Creating tidy data.
 * Section 3 Variable names with explanations.
